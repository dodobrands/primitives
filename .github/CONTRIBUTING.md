# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make via issue with the owners of this repository before making a change.

## Pull Request Process

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from main.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Increase `Version`. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](https://semver.org/).
5. Ensure the test suite passes.
6. Issue that pull request.
7. Properly fill pull request body section. Best practice here is to describe your changes as a list of changes and add link to the according issue for each change.
